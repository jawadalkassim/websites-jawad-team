					<p class="mt-2">Like most websites, we also collect routine device and other data through the Website, and we use data to deliver advertisements that may be of interest to you.</p>
					
					<h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose information of users, both online and offline. Please also see our separate <a href="terms-and-conditions.php" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Terms of Service</a>, which incorporate by reference this Privacy Policy and include definitions applicable to this Privacy Policy.</p>
					
					<p class="mt-2">Unless otherwise expressly stated, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party practices, websites, or services. Each third party will have its own privacy practices and policies, which you should review before using them.</p>
					
					<h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">HOW DO WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION?</h4>

					<p class="mt-2">As part of our business, we disclose information as follows and for the outlined purposes, which include business purposes to provide and improve the Service and comply with legal and contractual obligations, as well as commercial purposes, such as to market our business.</p>
					
					<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
					
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Insurers.</strong> If you submit a Request, we may share your personal information with Insurers so that they can contact you about your insurance options and other financial services.</li>

Such disclosure is for the business purpose of providing you with information or services that you have requested or considered.</li>

						<div class="mt-2 p-2 border border-1 border-gray-600 font-semibold">For example, if you utilize any “live chat" feature on our website, your chat transcripts may be monitored in real time by and/or shared with our third-party service providers, such as our customer service agents and customer management software.</div>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Cookies/Device Data.</strong> For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies, see below. Such disclosure is for our business purposes, in particular to provide you with the Service, as well as commercial purposes, such as to market to consumers that may be interested in our Service or related offers. Company may also contract with third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use cookies or other measures to collect non-identifier information.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Legal Process and Protection.</strong> We may disclose information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, such as to respond to government requests, law enforcement inquiries, legal processes, subpoenas, and court orders. We may disclose information when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to illegal, fraudulent, or injurious actions or security incidents that may cause harm to us, the Service, or others. We may also disclose information in good faith where necessary to investigate or enforce a violation of this Privacy Policy, our <a href="terms-and-conditions.php" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">terms</a>, or any legal rights.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Consent.</strong> We may disclose information as requested or consented to by you. Such disclosure may be for any business or commercial purpose as described to you.</li>
						
					</ul>
												
					<h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">HOW DO WE USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">As with many companies, we may use cookies, pixels, gifs, web beacons, log files, and/or similar technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use the Service or interact with our digital media content, such as when you visit our website. This allows us to track individual users, determine when content is accessed, and customize user experiences. For example, unless you have opted out of cookies or changed your cookie settings in your internet browser, your browser automatically sends us certain device, browser, internet connection, and general geolocation information and certain internet activity information. For instance, we may collect your mobile device identifier or MAC address, ISP carrier information, date and time you access the Service, the pages you visit, and whether you click on ads.

					<p class="mt-2">As part of our practices, we may use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on your online activity and to provide ad-related services such as analytics and market research. Third parties, in turn, may use a cookie, web beacon, or other similar technology to collect information.

					<p class="mt-2">In particular, we may use Google cookies and tools, such as Google Analytics and in certain cases Google Maps, for analytics and advertising and to improve the user experience, and your information may be shared with Google; for more information, visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en-US" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Google Cookie Policy</a>, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On</a>, or <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/home?sasb=true&ref=ad-settings" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Ads Settings</a>.

					<p class="mt-2">Please note that there are different types of cookies and related technologies, including session (temporary cookies that last for a browser session) and persistent (cookies that remain on a user's device for a specified period of time) cookies, which may be placed by us or third parties, including the following:</p>

					<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
					
						<li class="mt-2"><span class="underline offset-2 font-semibold">Essential Cookies (sometimes called Strictly Necessary Cookies):</span> these are automatically placed on your computer or device when you access our website. They are necessary to facilitate the operation of the Website and delivery of its content to your device. We use Essential Cookies to identify you as a unique use of the Website and to authenticate your login credentials.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><span class="underline offset-2 font-semibold">Functional/Preference Cookies:</span> these are used to remember your preferences and various settings for viewing the Website and improve overall functionality. Certain aspects of the Website may not work properly or at all absent these functional cookies.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><span class="underline offset-2 font-semibold">Analytics/Performance Cookies:</span> These cookies allow us to measure how you and other users are interacting with the website. We view the resulting performance statistics (or “analytics") and may make changes to the Services based on them.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><span class="underline offset-2 font-semibold">Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</span> These cookies track your activity on and off the Website and are used to identify visitors between different websites on the internet. Personal information collected through targeting cookies may be used to build a profile of user interests and deliver personalized advertising to such user.</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">DO WE SELL OR SHARE INFORMATION?</h4>

					<p class="mt-2">Yes. As stated in our <a href="terms-and-conditions.php" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Terms of Service</a>, we are lead generators and we may earn commissions or other fees when we pass on your information to a third-party Insurer with which you later do business. Under some privacy legislation, this constitutes a sale of personal information.</p>
					
					<p class="mt-2">Company participates in targeted ads, also called interest-based or online behavioral advertising, which may include cross-context behavioral advertising. Under some privacy legislation, this may constitute “selling" or “sharing" of personal information, such as for business purposes (e.g., providing our Service) and commercial purposes (e.g., other marketing). </p>

					<p class="mt-2">To opt out of these practices, contact us as outlined below and see our <a href="/footer/do-not-sell-my-info/" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</a> link.</p>

					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">HOW DO WE PROTECT AND TRANSFER INFORMATION?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">Consistent with others in our industry, we take efforts to employ technical, administrative, and physical security measures for personal information, taking into account reasonable security procedures and accessible technology. However, no system can be completely secure; and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. Your provision of personal information is at your own risk. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Take steps to safeguard your passwords and other data and notify us as soon as possible if you believe your account security has been breached.</p>
					
					<p class="mt-2 italic">If you are visiting the Service from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By using the Service, you authorize and specifically consent to the transfer of personal data to the United States and its storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN INFORMATION?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">We retain personal information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a different retention period is requested by you or required or permitted by law. For example, we will retain your personal information for as long as it is needed to provide you with the Service or fulfill a legal or contractual obligation. We may also aggregate, deidentify, or anonymize personal information as applicable for use in analytics, such as to analyze trends over periods of time without specifically identifying you.</p>
										
					<p class="mt-2">We use the following criteria to determine how long we retain personal information: (a) our relationship with you, such as if there is an open contract or account or a pending transaction or request; (b) legal obligations to retain personal information for certain purposes, such as to maintain transaction records; and (c) other obligations or considerations relating to the retention of data, such as contract requirements, litigation holds, investigations, or statutes of limitation.</p>
										
					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">We value consumer privacy rights and strive to provide flexibility with how your personal data is used and shared. If you want to make a privacy request or have any questions, please contact us through our Contact Form or email <a href="mailto:info@usaliferates.com" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">info@usaliferates.com</a> with your name and email address or other identifier used in connection with our Service so that we can verify your request. If an authorized agent is making a request on your behalf, the agent should provide its name and contact information, such as an email address, in addition to your information. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request; for example, if you make a request and we cannot verify your identity, or if you request deletion of data that we have a legal obligation to keep. Where we deny your request in whole or in part, we will take steps to inform you of the denial and provide an explanation of our actions and the reasons for the denial.</p>
					
					<p class="mt-2">Applicable privacy laws have different requirements and depend on various factors, such as where you live and how much revenue or data is at issue. Generally, we adhere to the following set of privacy rights to the extent applicable and subject to any limitations authorized by law. </p>

					<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
					
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Access.</strong> You can access and obtain your data and ask us for certain information, including: the categories of personal information collected and used; the categories of the sources of data; the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing data; the categories of third parties to whom data is disclosed; and the specific pieces of personal information collected. You also have a similar right to data portability (the ability to export, back up, and transfer data). </li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Amend.</strong> You can amend, correct, or rectify your data if it is inaccurate. </li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Delete.</strong> You can have your data deleted subject to certain legal limitations.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Limit.</strong> You can limit the processing of your data, in particular the use of automated decision making, such as profiling. We will also respond to recognized global opt-out preference signals where we can verify the request. For more information, see below.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to opt-out of certain data practices. For example, you can unsubscribe from marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions in each message or by contacting us as outlined in this Privacy Policy (please note that we may still send non-marketing messages, and that consent to receiving marketing communications is not mandatory to use the Service). You may also opt out of the “sale" or “sharing" or your personal information to the extent applicable. Please see our <a href="/footer/do-not-sell-my-info/" class="text-custom-blue font-semibold">Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</a> link. You may opt out of the use of automated decision-making technology if applicable. We will also respond to recognized global opt-out preference signals where we can verify the request. For more information, see below.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Complaints.</strong> You have the right to make certain complaints, including for privacy concerns. We value your feedback and seek the opportunity to work with you on any issues. You have the right to no discrimination for asserting your privacy rights. </li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Specific State Laws.</strong> Several states have enacted privacy laws that may apply to you, depending on the circumstances. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA"), updated by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA"), governs certain California-related conduct. Under California's “Shine the Light" law, California residents may also request certain information regarding Company sharing personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Further, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, California Business & Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content you have publicly posted. Please note that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of public content.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>European Laws.</strong> Generally, residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA") have the right to access your own information that we hold; to ask that your information be corrected, updated, or erased; and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing of your information. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data is your consent, the fulfillment of our obligations pursuant to the contract created between you and Company, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and does not violate your data protection interests or fundamental rights. You may withdraw your consent to our collection and use of your personal data. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information used in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
						
						<li class="mt-2"><strong>Other Laws.</strong> If certain other privacy laws apply to you that provide you with additional rights, please contact us to make a request, as we strive to comply with all privacy rights. </li>
						
					</ul>

					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN?</h4>
					
					<p class="mt-2">No, we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected such information, we will delete it from our database.

We do not have actual knowledge of selling or sharing the personal information of consumers under the age of 16.</p>

					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">HOW DO WE USE OR DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION?</h4>

					<p class="mt-2">We do not generally use or disclose “sensitive" personal information, nor do we use sensitive information for purposes other than those specified in the CPRA, which provides for the following uses without additional disclosures where the information is reasonably necessary and proportionate to the use: (a) to perform certain services, such as verifying information or for analytics; (b) to verify or maintain the quality or safety of our Service; (c) to perform services or provide goods reasonably expected; (d) for short-term use where there is no disclosure or profiling; and (e) to resist malicious, fraudulent, or illegal actions or to ensure physical safety. </p>

					<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">DO WE OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR YOUR DATA?</h4>
